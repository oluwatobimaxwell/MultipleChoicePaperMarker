Marking multiple choice answer sheets can be tedious most times. 
Teachers, especially those in secondary schools (Nigeria) will 
understand this problem very well. In schools, after exams, pile 
of these papers are collected as submissions in which teachers 
of subjects have to sit to mark one by one, row by row. Depending on the 
size of the class - the teacher spends lot of time marking, counting
and recording these scores in a scoresheet. Roughly a teacher will 
spend a minimum of 4 to 7 minutes to mark and record an answer sheet 
of 60 questions. If the teacher have a class of 40 to 60 students 
(as it is in many public secondary schools in Nigeria), he would spend
roughly 3 to 4 hours completeling the task. 

Although, I have talked just about time. There are still other things
that manual marking that cause - inaccuracy is another common thing.
And it is reasonable to thing that a teacher can not be completely 
perfect marking these papers.

To help developers build applications that teachers can use to reduce 
the time spent on marking, I wrote a python program that takes in
a snapped picture of the multple choice answer sheet and returned the 
selected options that the student selected. This can then be checked against
the correct answers to know the student's score. And all these can be done 
within 5 to 15 seconds per question paper of 60 questions.

This program is built using machine learning and image processing techniques
in OpenCV Python.
